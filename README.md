# Kernel-Kitchen
You are the CPU of a high-load restaurant server. Customers (Processes) are sending HTTP requests for food. Your job is to fetch data (ingredients) from the slow Hard Disk, load them into your limited fast RAM (the Notepad), compile them into a Dish, and serve the request before the connection times out.

For the list of rules, please see [rules-and-info.md](https://github.com/orangejuiceplz/Kernel-Kitchen/blob/main/rules-and-info.md)
